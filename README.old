You are to design and build a professional-grade *Secure IoT Deployment Management System* that demonstrates expertise in *network and security engineering* while being achievable for a highly skilled student project.

### Project Overview
The system should allow users to:
1. *Register and monitor IoT devices* (e.g., Raspberry Pi, smart sensors, cameras) through a secure dashboard.
2. *Automate vulnerability scanning* for all registered devices and display risk levels.
3. *Detect anomalous device behavior* using lightweight network traffic analysis (e.g., unexpected IP destinations, abnormal bandwidth usage).
4. *Send real-time security alerts* via email and dashboard notifications when threats are detected.
5. *Provide secure firmware update deployment* to IoT devices remotely.

### Core Requirements
- *Architecture*:  
  - Backend: Node.js (NestJS or Express) or Python (FastAPI or Django REST).  
  - Frontend: React.js or Vue.js (responsive, mobile-friendly).  
  - Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB (whichever fits best).  
  - Optional: Redis for caching device data.
- *Security*:  
  - JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (admin, standard user).  
  - All communication over TLS/HTTPS.  
  - Device communication encrypted with TLS and mutual authentication.  
  - Input sanitization and OWASP Top 10 compliance.
- *Device Integration*:  
  - Lightweight Python/Node agent script to install on IoT devices.  
  - Agent sends periodic heartbeat & telemetry (CPU, memory, network traffic) to the backend API.
- *Vulnerability Scanning*:  
  - Integrate open-source scanning tools (e.g., OpenVAS, Nmap scripts) via backend service.  
  - Store scan results and present them visually in the dashboard.
- *Anomaly Detection*:  
  - Implement a basic rules-based anomaly engine that flags unusual patterns in telemetry.  
  - Optional: Add simple ML anomaly detection using scikit-learn.

### UI/UX Features
- Modern, minimalistic dashboard with device list, security score, and alert feed.
- Device detail page showing live telemetry, recent scans, and logs.
- Graphs and charts for traffic patterns, CPU usage, and security trends.

### Additional Functionalities
- Export device data and scan reports as PDF/CSV.
- Firmware upload feature for admin to push signed updates to devices.
- Audit logs for all admin actions.

### Development Notes
- Prioritize clean, modular code with comments for educational clarity.
- Use Docker for containerized development.
- Provide an installation script and README with setup instructions.
- Include a test suite (Jest/Pytest) for core features.
- Make it scalable for future enhancements like AI-driven intrusion detection.

### Deliverables
1. Fully functional Secure IoT Deployment Management System (frontend + backend + device agent).
2. Database schema and API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).
3. Deployment guide for local dev and cloud hosting.
4. Security hardening checklist used during development.
5. Demo dataset for simulating multiple IoT devices.

Ensure the final product feels *enterprise-grade* in structure and security, but is still *achievable for a highly competent student* within a few weeks of focused work. Prioritize *clarity, scalability, and real-world relevance* so it can be showcased in a bursary application for a network & security engineering programme.
